### What are the ingredients of rava dosa and how to prepare rava dosa?
rava dosa is usually prepared with semolina, rice flour, maida, spices, and fresh herbs. First, take a bowl and add rava, rice flour, and maida to it. rava and rice flour should be in the same proportions, and maida should be half of the rava and rice flour. add salt, 1 tbsp of curd, and water to it. also, add chopped chilli, curry leaves, ginger, pepper, cumin seeds, and coriander leaves. add more water to prepare a flowing consistency batter. rest the batter for 20 minutes. sp that the rava absorbs water. pour the batter into the hot tawa and roast in low flame until the dosa leaves the tawa or turns golden brown and crisp.

### Why does rava dosa stick to the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-10.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
Always use a heavy bottom pan or well-seasoned cast-iron tawa to make rava dosa. An iron skillet pan is the best for preparing dosas. Seasoned tawa is the one that is used earlier to prepare dosa. grease the pan well and rub it with a slice of onion before pouring each dosa. Also, do not use the same tawa when preparing roti or chapati. maintain the tawa separately for both. If the dosa sticks to the non-stick tawa, pour some batter into it and prepare a small dosa. After 2-3 dosas, the dosas won’t stick to the pan as the tawa would be hot.

### Why is my rava dosa soft and not crispy?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-9.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
You need to use Bombay rava or fine rava. The batter should be thin and watery in consistency, not thick or medium. Medium-consistency batter also yields soft dosa. add water to the dosa batter to adjust the consistency. Adding more curd to the batter may yield soft dosas. The tawa should be very hot, and the flame should be low soon after pouring the batter into the tawa. Mix well every time you pour the batter on the tawa, and the rava and other flours settle down. Use a heavy bottom pan or cast iron tawa to prepare dosa so that it does not stick to the tawa and helps to get crispy dosa. also, serve dosa hot. else when they cool down, they turn soft.

### Should we flip over the dosa and roast on both sides in rava dosa?
Flipping of dosa is not required while roasting the rava dosa. When the dosa is cooked well, fold and remove it from the tawa. All the dosa needn’t be cooked on both sides. If the dosas are getting brown at the bottom and still moist on the top side, you may need to flip over the dosa and roast it on the other side until it turns crisp. So, as soon as the dosa is poured into the tawa, adjust the flame to low. cover and roast until the edges leave the tawa. Do not forcibly remove the dosa from the pan. A cooked dosa leaves the tawa, which indicates the cooking is done.

### How to pour the rava dosa batter into the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-7.jpeg> "rava dosa recipe")
The batter should be mainly thin or watery like flowing consistency. Only then is it possible to pour the batter. unlike traditional dosa, the batter is poured on the tawa, and the batter is not spread. pour it all over the tawa, beginning from the edges and towards the centre, and do not pour the batter in one place. fill the gaps by pouring the batter into them. cover and roast in low flame until it leaves the pan.

### What does my rava dosa break?
When you pour the batter into the tawa, make sure the batter is thin and flowing consistency. if it’s too skinny, the dosa might break. so add rice flour, maida, and rava according to their proportion and adjust the consistency, pour the batter into the pan.

### how to season the dosa tawa?
dosa tawa can be seasoned in the following ways: rub the tawa with gingelly oil and soak it in washed rice water for a week. rub the tawa with half the onion before spreading the dosas. heat the tawa, sprinkle salt, switch off the flame, wipe with a cloth and grease oil after it cools. clean the tawa with hot water and rub it with oil. Please keep it in the oven for one-hour upside down. Also, please do not wash the tawa when it is too hot, and do not put cold liquids on the cast iron tawa. avoid hard soaps, detergents, and steel scrubbers.

  7. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the flavors are well absorbed. Adjust the consistency as required.  !

  9. Pour the tempering over the dal and mix gently.  !

It is typically prepared during the Makara Sankranti or Pongal festival and served as a Prasadam with other festival delicacies.
There are many different ways to make this simple, **Sweet Pongal Recipe**. The traditional Sakkarai Pongal is made with a simple combination of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee with cardamom toppings. It can be extended by adding coconut to make it rich and creamy. Further, the rice can be skipped, and thick Poha can be added to make it a rice-free ponga recipe. Lastly, you can use a range of millets and broken wheat if you need a healthy variant.

[…] I am a big fan of Indian cuisines, and I occasionally re-post relevant recipes on my blog and my Instagram channel. Hebbar’s Kitchen is one of my favorite sites, and I was excited to see that Archana (who manages the site with her husband Sudarshan) had just published a Sweet Pongal Temple Style recipe. […]

  5. sandhya 
Looks Amazing. Just a small suggestion. For cooking dhall and rice, instead of using just water, try to use milk and water combined. Milk will gives a rich taste and creamy texture to pongal. Thanks.

thanks for sharing variation

## About Lemon Rasam
This is an easy yet healthy rasam or thin soup recipe made with lentil water and a hint of fresh herbs and spices. Once **Lemon Rasam** or **Nimbu Rasam** is prepared, it is topped with a generous amount of lemon juice, hence the name lemon rasam. It is typically served just before the meal as soup or as an appetiser with rice before the sambar rice meal. It also carries medicinal health benefits, and hence, it is served during indigestion or constipation problems.
There are many different ways to make this simple **Lemon Rasam recipe**. The most common way is to make it with leftover lentil-cooked water, which gives it a thin, watery consistency. However, it can also be made with moderate thickness by adding the cooked lentils to diluted water. The other way is to make it without lentils; it is cooked with water, herbs, spices, and lemon topping.

## About Curd Dosa
It is an easy, simple, soft, spongy dosa made with semolina, beaten rice, and sour curd or yogurt. Curd Dosa most commonly known as Sponge Dosa is an instant variant of the Set Dosa recipe. It is instant and does not require additional fermentation, soaking, and grounding which makes it super convenient. Typically, it can be served with any type of chutney, but it tastes great when served with spicy curry like kurma and any meat or potato curries.
There are many types of **curd dosa** and **sponge dosa** but the most common way is to make with semolina and Poha. These 2 dry ingredients are mixed with curd to make a medium-textured dosa batter. The same dosa can also be made with rice flour or idli rava. The texture of the latter can be different and may not be as soft as semolina. In addition, the same dosa can be made with rice and urad dal, but it does require soaking, grounding, and fermentation.

Can we store the batter without adding curd and add curd night before we wanna make?
     *  
Hi Sowmya, curd helps in fermentation here. As we are not adding urad dal, curd would be essential to ferment the batter

## About Idli Chutney
This is a classical adaptation of the simple coconut chutney which carries a unique and Idli-friendly texture and taste. In other words, **Idli chutney** has a more watery texture which acts like sambar and makes it easy to consume the soft and moist idli. Having said that the chutney is not limited to it. It can also be used for other South Indian breakfast recipes too. Particularly, it can also be an ideal choice for dosa, paddu, appam, and even for Idiyappam rice noodles.
There are different ways to make this simple chutney, but the common ingredient used is coconut. Depending upon the region and the additional ingredient used, the taste and consistency changes to this **Idli Chutney**. The most common ingredient used is roasted channa dal, but it can also take roasted peanuts. Also for the sourness, you can add raw mangoes in place of tamarind.

## About Badam Burfi
An excellent and tasty Indian sweet recipe made with a combination of powdered almond and desiccated coconut in a one-string sugar syrup. **Badam Burfi,** known as Badam Katli, is an ideal festival recipe for offering Prasadam to beloved gods. It can also be a perfect sweet snack and be served and exchanged with friends and family. In addition, it is also considered a healthy alternative compared to other dry fruits and sweets, significant because of Almonds.
There are many different ways to make this classical **Badam Burfi Recipe**. The variations mainly differ from the supporting ingredients added to this classical dessert. The typical combination is coconut, but it is not limited. It can take other dry fruit powders like cashews, pasta, and dates. Adding these makes it richer and premium, with just badam powder. In addition, adding rava, besan, and even wheat powder can give it a crunchy texture.

## instant jalebi recipe | homemade crispy jalebi step by step photo recipe:

### preparing sugar syrup:
  1. firstly, take 1 cup sugar in a pan and add ¼ cup water.  !
  2. keep stirring on low flame, so that the sugar dissolves. !
  3. boil the sugar syrup and add saffron.  !
  4. cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.  !
  5. once one string consistency is attained, switch off the flame and add ½ tsp lemon juice and cardamom powder. lemon helps to avoid crystallizing sugar syrup and keeps your jalebis crispy.  !

### **preparing jalebi batter:**
  1. firstly, in a mixing bowl, take ½ cup all purpose flour or maida, 1 tsp corn flour, 1 tsp curd and 1/8th tsp of food colour.  !
  2. mix all the above ingredients with a spoon.  !
  3. then add half tsp vinegar and 5 – 6 tsp water. the amount of water to be added slowly and as required.  !
  4. whisk well in round circular directions for 5 minutes. this adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.  !
  5. now add ¼ tsp of baking soda and give a gentle mix.  !
  6. further small bubbles appear on the top. stir the batter lightly and it should have a flowing consistency.  !
  7. now pour this batter in the tomato ketchup bottles carefully.  !

### **frying jalebis:**
  1. firstly, heat oil in a pan and add 1 tbsp of ghee. ghee gives a better flavour. make sure your pan is not too shallow and should be approximately 1 inch deep for frying jalebis.  !
  2. now squeeze the bottle and make round spirals with the batter.  !
  3. furthermore, when one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.  !
  4. also fry till the jalebis are a light golden. remove with a tongs and shake to drain the extra oil.  !
  5. then immediately drop the fried jalebis in the warm sugar syrup.  !
  6. dip and turn over so that both sides are coated with the syrup.  !
  7. remove and shake lightly and place them in a plate.  !
  8. finally, serve **jalebi****recipe** hot, warm or at room temperature. store the leftovers jalebi in an airtight container and refrigerated.  !

## notes:
  * firstly, to get rich yellow colour to your jalebis, add yellow food colour. however it is optional.
  * in addition, make sure your pan is not too shallow and should be approximately 1 inch deep for frying jalebis.
  * furthermore, don’t worry if you won’t get perfect shapes in first attempt as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. you need to be quick and this does require some practice.
  * finally, if you like your **jalebi recipe** too sweety then keep in sugar syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Taste was really good, but I have a doubt after adding lime water also my sugar syrup became crystallized after few hours, wat should I do to avoid crystallizing of sugar syrup??? But once again thanks for the simple and easy recipe.
     *  
adding lemon juice prevents sugar from crystallising..

## About Badam Burfi
An excellent and tasty Indian sweet recipe made with a combination of powdered almond and desiccated coconut in a one-string sugar syrup. **Badam Burfi,** known as Badam Katli, is an ideal festival recipe for offering Prasadam to beloved gods. It can also be a perfect sweet snack and be served and exchanged with friends and family. In addition, it is also considered a healthy alternative compared to other dry fruits and sweets, significant because of Almonds.
There are many different ways to make this classical **Badam Burfi Recipe**. The variations mainly differ from the supporting ingredients added to this classical dessert. The typical combination is coconut, but it is not limited. It can take other dry fruit powders like cashews, pasta, and dates. Adding these makes it richer and premium, with just badam powder. In addition, adding rava, besan, and even wheat powder can give it a crunchy texture.

## About Sabudana Khichdi
It is a popular and healthy dish from Indian cuisine made with tapioca pearls, potatoes, herbs, and spices. **Sabudana Khichdi** is known for its fast energy boost and hence it is typically served as a meal replacement during festival fasting seasons. In addition, it is also most commonly served as breakfast or even a tiffin box meal. The recipe is extremely simple and easy to prepare but can take some practice to make a nonstick and nonmushy khichdi.
There are many different ways to make this simple **Sabudana ki khichadi,** which mainly varies with the region it is prepared. The most common and basic way to prepare for this khichdi is by using the soaked sago pearls and boiled potatoes tossed with spices and herbs. The other easy way is to make it via soup which is most commonly known as liquid soup. The soaked tapioca pearls can also be made like upma which is known as Sabudana Upma.

## Tips for Sabudana Khichdi
The recipe is super simple to make this recipe with very less and basic ingredients used to make this khichdi recipe. Yet basic tips to make this perfect are –
  1. **Proper Sabudana –** Choosing the right sized and best quality of Sabudana or sago pearls is essential to any Sabudana Recipe. Typically small to medium-sized sago pearls are best for this recipe.
  2. **Soaking –** The water to Sabudana ratio while soaking is very critical. I generally follow a 1:3/4 ratio of Sabudana and water, but you can increase it depending on the quality of Sabudana used. Also, rinse and wash the Sabudana thoroughly till all excess starch is removed.
  3. **Potatoes –** Generally pressured cooked/boiled and diced potatoes are just added to the khichdi. This helps to hasten the cooking process. But you may add directly to the cooking pan or even microwave them before using it.
  4. **Cooking Time –** The cooking can be an overwhelming process as it has to be cooked on low to medium flame. Keep patience and stir gently so that it does not damage the sago pearls.
  5. **Experiment –** The recipe is mainly prepared during the fasting season with fasting ingredients. However, it is not limited to it. It can be extended to other ingredients like coconut, curry leaves, onions, etc.

## About Sukhdi or Gond Pak:
It is basically a simple sweet dessert snack recipe made with just 3 ingredients i.e. wheat, jaggery, and ghee. However, this **sukhdi recipe** is slightly extended with a few more additional ingredients like gond, cardamom and also cashews, and almonds. This is typically made in Gujarati cuisine and is typically served for auspicious occasions and festivals. Also compared to other premium dry sweets, it is much simpler to make due to the minimal set of ingredients used in it.
The main selling point of this **gond pak recipe** is its texture. Due to the use of roasted wheat flour mixed with melted jaggery and hot ghee, it gains a crispy or crunchy texture. In addition, when gond  are mixed, it elevates the taste and eating experience. In addition, some variations also include a generous topping of finely chopped dry fruits making it more attractive.

## About Veg Biriyani
It is basically a vegetarian alternative to the popular meat-based rice biriyani dedicated to vegetarian or non-meat eaters. In other **Veg Biriyani** most commonly known as Veg Dum Biriyani is made with a combination of vegetables as an alternative to meat variants like chicken or mutton options. The concept of Veg Biriyani was introduced very recently but has gained a lot of popularity among both veg and non-vegetarians. It is mainly due to the combination of authentic flavor, taste, and the range of spices it has to offer.
There are myriad ways to make this simple and tasty rice-based dish, but the most common way is the **Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani Recipe**. In this variant, the rice and gravy are cooked separately but then layered and slow-cooked. This style of slow cooking is known as Dum cooking. This also helps to infuse a lot of flavor to the long grain rice from the gravy, yet keeping the integrity of the rice. The other popular ways include mixing rice and gravy together to make moist and flavored rice. This can be either pressure-cooked or pan-cooked.

## Chef Tips for Veg Biriyani
There are many variables to be considered while preparing the biriyani recipe. Some simple and effective tips should really help to make it better
  1. **Rice selection –** The typical choice for any biriyani recipe is long-grain basmati rice. Particularly it is cooked in such a fashion that, it remains long, non-sticky, and not mushy. There are other types of biriyani where other types of rice can be chosen. However, basmati rice is most recommended.
  2. **Slow cooking –** The taste of biriyani builds as it gets cooked slowly in a slow flame. Particularly the dum biriyani has to be cooked in that way. More importantly, the biriyani tastes great when rested.
  3. **Vegetables –** The choice of vegetables is super important for veg biriyani. The most basic combination is potatoes, carrots, beans, peas and mushrooms. Also, do not overpower each other and keep it balanced.
  4. **Biriyani Masala –** Biriyani Spice Mix plays a huge role in this rice-based dish. I typically use homemade or Shaan Brand Bombay Biriyani Mix for most of my biriyani recipes. However, any tried and tested spice mix can be used with the below-mentioned recipe.
  5. **Accompaniments –** Typically the dum biriyani is served with spicy gravy Mirchi ka Salan and raita. Salan, helps t make raise more flavored and moist whereas the raita helps to lower the spice level.

## Why does this recipe work
There are many simple and complex reasons why the biriyani recipe is super popular across India if not globally. Some major reasons are
  1. **Premium Flavor –** In Indian cuisine, the rice biriyani is considered to be the most flavored and tasty rice recipe. There are various instant and traditional rice-based pulao and fried rice, but nothing comes close to the flavors of the biriyani recipe.
  2. **One Pot Meal –** Compared to the other rice or bread recipes, which typically require curry, dal, or sambar. The biriyani recipes do not require any additional main dishes to serve with it.
  3. **Comfort Food –** Traditionally, biriyani recipes were considered as premium limited to celebrations and festivals. However, due to its popularity, it is now used in day-to-day meals due to its comfort and pleasing appetite.
  4. **Versatility –** The rice and biryani gravy can be cooked in multiple ways. The most common way is the dum style with rice and gravy cooked in layers. Alternatively, you can mix it all together and pressure cook it. Also, it can take, meat, veggies, and a combination of mixed herbs.
  5. **Healthy –** Due to the combination of spices used with rice and fresh herbs, it is considered to be digestion-friendly and improves gut health. Particularly, the meat biriyani is a packaged meal with all proteins, carbs, and fiber in one meal.

### How to get a crispy rava dosa?

### What are the ingredients of rava dosa and how to prepare rava dosa?
rava dosa is usually prepared with semolina, rice flour, maida, spices, and fresh herbs. First, take a bowl and add rava, rice flour, and maida to it. rava and rice flour should be in the same proportions, and maida should be half of the rava and rice flour. add salt, 1 tbsp of curd, and water to it. also, add chopped chilli, curry leaves, ginger, pepper, cumin seeds, and coriander leaves. add more water to prepare a flowing consistency batter. rest the batter for 20 minutes. sp that the rava absorbs water. pour the batter into the hot tawa and roast in low flame until the dosa leaves the tawa or turns golden brown and crisp.

### What are the other variants to prepare tasty rava dosa?

### Why does rava dosa stick to the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-10.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
Always use a heavy bottom pan or well-seasoned cast-iron tawa to make rava dosa. An iron skillet pan is the best for preparing dosas. Seasoned tawa is the one that is used earlier to prepare dosa. grease the pan well and rub it with a slice of onion before pouring each dosa. Also, do not use the same tawa when preparing roti or chapati. maintain the tawa separately for both. If the dosa sticks to the non-stick tawa, pour some batter into it and prepare a small dosa. After 2-3 dosas, the dosas won’t stick to the pan as the tawa would be hot.

### Why is my rava dosa soft and not crispy?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-9.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
You need to use Bombay rava or fine rava. The batter should be thin and watery in consistency, not thick or medium. Medium-consistency batter also yields soft dosa. add water to the dosa batter to adjust the consistency. Adding more curd to the batter may yield soft dosas. The tawa should be very hot, and the flame should be low soon after pouring the batter into the tawa. Mix well every time you pour the batter on the tawa, and the rava and other flours settle down. Use a heavy bottom pan or cast iron tawa to prepare dosa so that it does not stick to the tawa and helps to get crispy dosa. also, serve dosa hot. else when they cool down, they turn soft.

### Should we flip over the dosa and roast on both sides in rava dosa?
Flipping of dosa is not required while roasting the rava dosa. When the dosa is cooked well, fold and remove it from the tawa. All the dosa needn’t be cooked on both sides. If the dosas are getting brown at the bottom and still moist on the top side, you may need to flip over the dosa and roast it on the other side until it turns crisp. So, as soon as the dosa is poured into the tawa, adjust the flame to low. cover and roast until the edges leave the tawa. Do not forcibly remove the dosa from the pan. A cooked dosa leaves the tawa, which indicates the cooking is done.

### How to pour the rava dosa batter into the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-7.jpeg> "rava dosa recipe")
The batter should be mainly thin or watery like flowing consistency. Only then is it possible to pour the batter. unlike traditional dosa, the batter is poured on the tawa, and the batter is not spread. pour it all over the tawa, beginning from the edges and towards the centre, and do not pour the batter in one place. fill the gaps by pouring the batter into them. cover and roast in low flame until it leaves the pan.

### What does my rava dosa break?
When you pour the batter into the tawa, make sure the batter is thin and flowing consistency. if it’s too skinny, the dosa might break. so add rice flour, maida, and rava according to their proportion and adjust the consistency, pour the batter into the pan.

### how to season the dosa tawa?
dosa tawa can be seasoned in the following ways: rub the tawa with gingelly oil and soak it in washed rice water for a week. rub the tawa with half the onion before spreading the dosas. heat the tawa, sprinkle salt, switch off the flame, wipe with a cloth and grease oil after it cools. clean the tawa with hot water and rub it with oil. Please keep it in the oven for one-hour upside down. Also, please do not wash the tawa when it is too hot, and do not put cold liquids on the cast iron tawa. avoid hard soaps, detergents, and steel scrubbers.

Looks Amazing. Just a small suggestion. For cooking dhall and rice, instead of using just water, try to use milk and water combined. Milk will gives a rich taste and creamy texture to pongal. Thanks.

## About Banana Buns
An easy and simple deep-fried snack or puffy bread recipe made with plain flour and ripe bananas. It is most commonly prepared in the South Canara region of Karnataka state, and hence, it is referred to as **Mangalore Buns** or simple **Banana Buns**. It is typically served with spicy coconut chutney but tastes great with idli sambar or a flavoured kurma recipe. Typically, it is served for breakfast in the morning, but it is not limited to it. It can also be an ideal evening snack with a cup of tea or coffee.
This simple and healthy snack has many variations. The most common way is to make it with maida and ripe bananas. Another healthy combination is to make it with wheat flour and ripe bananas. This would make it healthy but may not have the right texture as the traditional one. The other variations are making it with different types of bananas, yielding differently textured buns.

       * Preethi Vinod 
Oh nooo In the pictures it doesn’t look like 1/4 cup curd Looks like 2 tablespoons Is that what happened?
         *  
i have added 1/4cup curd.
       *  
it depends on quality of banana and consistency of curd used..

## About Lemon Rasam
This is an easy yet healthy rasam or thin soup recipe made with lentil water and a hint of fresh herbs and spices. Once **Lemon Rasam** or **Nimbu Rasam** is prepared, it is topped with a generous amount of lemon juice, hence the name lemon rasam. It is typically served just before the meal as soup or as an appetiser with rice before the sambar rice meal. It also carries medicinal health benefits, and hence, it is served during indigestion or constipation problems.
There are many different ways to make this simple **Lemon Rasam recipe**. The most common way is to make it with leftover lentil-cooked water, which gives it a thin, watery consistency. However, it can also be made with moderate thickness by adding the cooked lentils to diluted water. The other way is to make it without lentils; it is cooked with water, herbs, spices, and lemon topping.

## How to Make Kodubale with Step-by-step Photos
  1. Firstly, in a large mixing bowl, take ½ cup rice flour.  !
  2. Also, add in ¼ cup rava and ½ cup maida.  !
  3. Additionally, add ½ tsp ajwain, hing and salt to taste.  !
  4. Combine well, making sure everything mixes well.  !
  5. Furthermore, pour 2 tbsp of hot oil. This helps to give extra crunchiness to kodubale.  !
  6. Mix with the spoon, as the oil will be too hot.  !
  7. Furthermore, crumble the flour well with oil. Keep aside.  !
  8. Meanwhile, prepare the masala by taking ¼ cup of coconut in a blender.  !
  9. Also, add ½ tsp jeera and five whole red chillies.  !
  10. Blend to smooth paste, adding water as required.  !
  11. Now, transfer the prepared masala paste over the flour.  !
  12. Knead the dough well adding water if required.  !
  13. Knead to smooth and soft dough as chapati dough.  !
  14. Furthermore, pinch a dough ball and press & knead again 5 times.  !
  15. Also, roll gently to form a thick and long rope. If you cannot roll, add a tsp of more maida and knead the dough.  !
  16. Cut the rope approximately 2 inches in length.  !
  17. And join the edges to form a circle.  !
  18. Now, deep fry the module in hot oil in batches. Do not overcrowd the module, as it takes a long time to cook.  !
  19. Fry the kodubale on a medium flame, ensuring they are cooked thoroughly.  !
  20. Fry the kodubale till it turns golden brown and crisp. It takes around 6 minutes.  !
  21. Drain off onto a piece of kitchen paper to remove excess oil.  !
  22. Finally, enjoy **double** or store it in an airtight container for 10-15 days once it’s cooled completely.  !

## Notes
  * Firstly, the spicy ring murukku will turn soggy if the dough is too soft.
  * Also, adding hot oil to the flour gives a nice crispiness to the murukku.
  * Most noteworthy, do not make the dough too soft, as it absorbs oil, and the hard dough will be too hard to bite.
  * Finally, don’t add water to the whole mix if you make it in large quantities. Instead, add water in batches to prevent **double from** turning soggy.

Looks Amazing. Just a small suggestion. For cooking dhall and rice, instead of using just water, try to use milk and water combined. Milk will gives a rich taste and creamy texture to pongal. Thanks.

## About Curd Dosa
It is an easy, simple, soft, spongy dosa made with semolina, beaten rice, and sour curd or yogurt. Curd Dosa most commonly known as Sponge Dosa is an instant variant of the Set Dosa recipe. It is instant and does not require additional fermentation, soaking, and grounding which makes it super convenient. Typically, it can be served with any type of chutney, but it tastes great when served with spicy curry like kurma and any meat or potato curries.
There are many types of **curd dosa** and **sponge dosa** but the most common way is to make with semolina and Poha. These 2 dry ingredients are mixed with curd to make a medium-textured dosa batter. The same dosa can also be made with rice flour or idli rava. The texture of the latter can be different and may not be as soft as semolina. In addition, the same dosa can be made with rice and urad dal, but it does require soaking, grounding, and fermentation.

Can we store the batter without adding curd and add curd night before we wanna make?
     *  
Hi Sowmya, curd helps in fermentation here. As we are not adding urad dal, curd would be essential to ferment the batter
  4. Karen

## About Idli Chutney
This is a classical adaptation of the simple coconut chutney which carries a unique and Idli-friendly texture and taste. In other words, **Idli chutney** has a more watery texture which acts like sambar and makes it easy to consume the soft and moist idli. Having said that the chutney is not limited to it. It can also be used for other South Indian breakfast recipes too. Particularly, it can also be an ideal choice for dosa, paddu, appam, and even for Idiyappam rice noodles.
There are different ways to make this simple chutney, but the common ingredient used is coconut. Depending upon the region and the additional ingredient used, the taste and consistency changes to this **Idli Chutney**. The most common ingredient used is roasted channa dal, but it can also take roasted peanuts. Also for the sourness, you can add raw mangoes in place of tamarind.

There are different ways the simple **Methi Dal Fry recipe** can be made, but the most common combination is the toor dal and fresh methi leaves.

## About Curd Rice
It is a popular simple and healthy rice and yogurt-based meal recipe known for its cooling and health benefits. In other words, **South Indian Curd Rice** or **Thayir Sadam Rice** is a traditional dish made by mixing cooked rice with creamy and sour yogurt with additional spices and herbs. It is generally served after a spicy meal to lower the body temperature which internally helps the digestion and human gut. In addition, it can also be a popular choice, especially during the summer or hot season.
There are myriad ways to make this simple and healthy **South Indian Curd Rice** , but the basic and simple one is to combine cooked rice and yogurt. In addition, full cream milk can also be added to the prepared rice. Adding milk helps to keep the taste balanced particularly if the prepared rice is rested as yogurt can turn sour. The other popular way is to mix the freshly prepared steamed cooked rice. The warm rice when mixed with chilled yogurt, helps to create a soothing effect and hence it is much appreciated.

## Chef Tips for Curd Rice
The recipe is very simple without many complicated ingredients involved in preparing it. Yet I would like to add some tips and suggestions to make it super tasty are –
  1. **Rice Quality –** Typically the curd rice is prepared using short or mid rice grains. The best type of rice is Ponni or Sona Masuri rice and avoid Basmati rice. In addition, use cooked rice that is properly rested and at room temperature.
  2. **Yogurt Quality –** The Curd or Yogurt has to be fresh, thick and creamy. Avoid using stale or old yogurt as it may be sour and may imbalance the taste and flavor of the rice. Also, if the yogurt is sour, you may add 1-2 tsp of sugar to balance the flavor.
  3. **Seasoning –** Once the yogurt rice is prepared, it has to be tempered and garnished for additional flavors. Particularly, the tempering has to be done with ghee, mustard, urad dal, red chilies, and curry leaves. The garnish can be done with coriander leaves, pomegranate, and mint leaves.
  4. **Texture –** The consistency of the Thayir Sadam Rice is critical. It has to be semi-thick with rice mashed sufficiently. The texture of yogurt plays a critical role in the final result and hence try to use thick and creamy yogurt.
  5. **Serving –** Once the yogurt rice is prepared, it is better to rest it so that the flavors and taste blend in. It can also be served chilled and it is better served after the spicy meal. Also, serving it with simple dal or a spicy pickle would help to elevate the taste.

  10. Finally, enjoy the **Curd Rice Recipe** with pickle and papad.  !

## Notes:
  * First, adjust the consistency of curd rice by adding curd and milk to make it creamy.
  * Also, adding cream makes curd rice rich and flavourful.
  * Additionally, always use Sona Masuri or any short-grain rice to make curd rice.
  * Finally, if you are packing a **Curd Rice Recipe** for a lunch box then add more milk rather than curd to avoid turning sour.

  2. next, add 1 cup of idli rava. rinse them well, if they are not clean.  !

## About Mumbai Pav Bhaji
Like most Indian recipes, the Mumbai Pav Bhaji has an exciting history. It is believed that the recipe was invented during the 1850s by mill workers. They would bring all the leftover vegetables and cook them freshly during the lunch break with a blend of spices. In addition, because of the short lunch breaks, it was served with local pav bread. Also, it was easy to source this bread, and more importantly, with the combination of curry, it was filling and tasty.
Gradually, the dish became popular across India due to the migrating working class. This dish has become iconic in Mumbai and an essential part of tourism. Moreover, it has undergone many variations, and you can get so many different flavours, colours, and a wide range of toppings in this recipe. Yet one thing remains consistent with this recipe. That is the unique spice mix used for this recipe. Masala powder is vital to get this recipe’s authentic flavour and taste. Hence, it is noteworthy to choose a quality pav bhaji mix powder.

## Chef Tips for Pav Bhaji
The recipe of Pav Bhaji is simple and easy to prepare with basic and readily available ingredients. Yet some of the critical tips for best results are –
  1. **Fresh Ingredients****—** Always prepare this bhaji curry with fresh and tender vegetables. The spice mix and wet ingredients must also be fresh and full of aroma for best results.
  2. **Masala Powder****—** Different Pav Bhaji Masala Powder types are commercially available but may not be relevant to individual taste preferences. Hence, try out and stick to the best one. Alternatively, you can use the homemade one for the best results.
  3. **Butter****vs. Ghee—** The best choice of wet ingredients is combining cooking oil with butter. Butter does not add a robust flavour compared to ghee. However, you may use a ghee and oil combination if you do not have butter.
  4. **Texture –** The bhaji’s texture must be coarse and not fine or smooth. Use a hand masher to mash all the cooked vegetables. Do not use a blender to mash as it may get soft, even-textured bhaji.
  5. **Garnish****—** Toppings and garnishing are essential steps before serving. Use finely chopped onions, coriander, and lemon juices. In addition, adding a scoop of butter makes it more flavoured and enjoyable.

## Faqs:

#### What is pav bhaji?
Pav bhaji is a world-famous fast food or king of street food famous in Maharashtra. The vegetables are mixed with a unique blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala. It is served with soft bread or pav with a generous amount of butter topped with chopped onions and lemon juice.

#### How to get a dark red colour for pav bhaji?
To get a dark red colour for pav bhaji, use Kashmiri red chillies. This gives a bright red colour to the pav bhaji and has less spice heat. In addition, use beetroot with other vegetables to give it a bright red colour. Avoid using an artificial colour which is not good for your health.

#### Which veggies we can add? Can we make pav bhaji without using onions?
Yes, definitely you can make pav bhaji without using onions. Just skip the onions, keeping all the ingredients the same. Usually, vegetables include onions, tomatoes, capsicum, potatoes, and peas. But this recipe can also be extended by adding carrots, cauliflower, beans, paneer, and veggies of your choice.

#### How to get the original street-side taste for the pav bhaji?
The key point to get the street side taste for the pav bhaji is to use fresh homemade pav bhaji masala. It is the heart and soul of this dish, and never compromise on it. Secondly, fry the veggies with a generous amount of butter and top them with butter on bhaji, adding flavour. In addition, use Kashmiri red chilies or chili powder for this recipe to get the bright red color to the bhaji. Finally, fry the pav or bread with a good quality of fresh butter. it will taste great when you prepare hot and spicy.

#### Can we use garam masala instead of pav bhaji masala?
Yes, you can add in case you don’t have pav bhaji masala. But it's always best to use pav bhaji masala if you can access it. In case you don’t have pav bhaji masala, add garam masala. In addition to it, you may have to add amchur powder or dry mango powder. But yes, the taste entirely varies when you use garam masala powder.

#### Which brand of pav bhaji masala works best?
Best pav bhaji masala is freshly homemade pav bhaji masala in which all the ingredients are dry roasted in low flame and blended to form a fine powder. Alternatively, you can use MTR, MDH, Everest, and any local Marathi Cuisine brand with a strong flavor and aroma to it.

#### What is pav bhaji masala made of?
Pav bhaji masala is made of dry roasting the spices individually on a low flame and blending them to form a fine powder. Here, spices include coriander seeds, cumin seeds, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, pepper, fennel seeds, Kashmiri red chili, turmeric powder, and amchur powder. if the masala is coarse, sieve it and blend the coarse powder once again. Preserve in an airtight container for a longer shelf life.

## About Maddur Vada
It is a simple, crisp, and crunchy deep-fried snack recipe made with a combination of rice flour, maida, and rava/sooji. The **Maddur Vada** most commonly known as **Maddur Vade** hails from the small town of Maddur from Karnataka. It is most commonly known to serve as an evening snack with a cup of tea or coffee, but not limited to it. It can also be an ideal side dish for any type of meal, including rasam rice or dal rice combo meal.
There are many different types of **Maddur Vada** , but the most common is made with rice flour, maida, and rava. The taste of this snack is derived from the onions combined with the above dry ingredients. The juice from onions is infused into the dough and tastes great when deep fried in low flame. The same vada can also be made with wheat flour as an alternative to maida. This makes it healthy but may not be a tasty snack. In addition, adding rava helps to make it crisp and crunchy, but optional.

## About Mysore Rasam
It is basically an extension of the traditional South Indian rasam recipe with an additional flavoring spice mixed with coconut. In other words, **Mysore Rasam** is a rasam recipe with slightly thicker in its consistency and also with a blend of spice mix flavors. It is typically served with rice or any flavored rice, but with the spice mix and consistency, it can also be served with dosa and idli recipes too.
Generally, Mysore Rasam was a popular choice, particularly for marriage or any celebrations feast. It was always considered a premium rasam or purpose-based soup. Therefore, the recipe instructions or particularly the Mysore Rasam powder were secretly held by a few chefs. However, this has been now a popular choice for every day to day meals, and hence the recipe started to get distributed.

## Chef Pro Tips:
The recipe is no rocket science and hence less likely to get it wrong. Yet I would like to emphasize on few mandatory or critical tips –
  1. **Homemade spice mix** – You may easily get store-bought spice mix for this recipe. However, my personal recommendation is to use homemade mix for fresh ingredients.
  2. **Tomato & Tamarind Ratio –** The sour taste is mandatory and hence tamarind is mandatory. However, due to the use of tomatoes and their own sourness, you may have to alter the quantity of tamarind.
  3. **Consistency –** The consistency of this rasam is slightly thicker when compared to the traditional rasam. Do not make it thin like other rasam as it may lose its taste and flavor.
  4. **Tadka (> "tempering")) –** This rasam requires the tadka as a mandatory. Also, give the tempering with ghee and avoid oil.
  5. **Over Boiling –** Once the spice mix is added, give it 2 minutes to boil. Do not overboil as it may leave a bitter taste.

## notes:
  * first of all, if your guliyappa is not getting golden brown, add some sugar.
  * in addition, adjust the consistency of the batter by adding required water.
  * furthermore, to make it little spicy, add some chopped chilli.
  * finally, skip the masala step and pour the batter directly to moulds, but these onion masala enhances the taste of guliyappa.

  * Also, add cream to make the gravy creamy. Do not compromise on it.
  * Additionally, you can cut the paneer into shape of your choice.
  * Finally, **Methi Malai Paneer Recipe** tastes great when made creamy and less spicy.

## About Aloo Chop
A classical Eastern Indian cuisine deep-fried snack recipe prepared with a combination of mashed potatoes, a blend of spice mix and besan batter. **Aloo Chop** , commonly known as **Bengali Potato Fritters** , is a popular West Bengal street food with spicy condiments like green chutney or tomato sauces. It is typically confused with spiced hashbrowns, but this is much more than that. It has a similar shape and texture to batata vada, but the blend of spices and potato mash makes it unique. Also, the shape is flat, like a disc, which is typical of this snack.
A simple **Aloo Chop** or **Alur Chop** snack is prepared in different ways. The most common way is to blend spice mix prepared in advance and mixed with boiled potatoes before deep frying. However, the variations can be quickly introduced based on how the spice mix is ready. Also, deep frying can be varied. You can use shallow, deep, and even air frying techniques. However, deep frying is the most tasty way. Also, the snack is open-ended and can take different types of condiments. It includes,
  * Green Chutney
  * Tamarind Sauce
  * Achar or Pickle
  * Mint Raita or Dip
  * Maggie Hot & Sweet Tomato Ketchup
  * Onion & Tomato mix

## About Dal Paratha
It is a popular and healthy lentil-stuffed Indian flatbread recipe from the rich and premium Rajasthani cuisine. **Dal Ka Paratha** , most commonly known as **Moong Dal Paratha** , is known for its texture and the layers it has to offer in each bite. In addition, due to the filling and protein-rich stuffing, it makes it one of the best paratha for lunch boxes and kids tiffin boxes. The bread is typically served with a combination of yoghurt dip/raita and spicy pickle. But it goes very well with different types of North Indian curries, including veg and non-veg.
There are many different ways to make this simple **Dal Paratha** or **lentil paratha recipe**. Mixing the lentil stuffing directly with the wheat or paratha dough is the most common way. This removes the complication of stuffing, rolling and pinning. The other common way is to stuff the lentils into the wheat dough pockets. This may need some hand-eye coordination and may not be easy for beginners. Lastly, the same recipe can be made with other types of lentils or a combination of lentils.

  * also, make sure to get just 1 string consistency of sugar syrup. else it turns burfi hard and brittle.
  * most noteworthy, use nonstick pan for easy and efficient badam katlis.
  * and entire badam burfi has to be prepared on low flame.
  * finally, instead of butter paper, you can also use a plastic sheet or greased plate to prepare **badam burfi.**

## About Atta Besan Ladoo
It is a simple combination of 2 recipes, i.e. wheat and besan ladoo, combined to make a classic Indian dessert recipe. Traditionally, besan ladoo is prepared during festivals and religious ceremonies. However, it can have health concerns, as chickpea flour can upset your stomach. Hence, to mitigate this problem, a new Laddu recipe is prepared. One is the Atta Ladoo, commonly called the **Atta Besan Ladoo recipe**. It has the same taste and crunchiness as besan but carries the health benefits of wheat flour.
There are many ways to make a simple and healthy **Atta Besan Ladoo recipe**. The most common way is to prepare it with a combination of wheat and chickpea flour with a 1:1 ratio. This gets the best of both. However, the ratio can be altered to make a unique sweet recipe. In addition, adding roasted rava or semolina makes it crisp and crunchy. Further, adding assorted dry fruits with dry ingredients makes it a memorable and premium sweet dessert recipe.

## About Onion Paratha
An easy and simple stuffed flatbread recipe made with wheat flour and a combination of onions and besan spiced masala. **Onion Paratha** , most commonly known as **Pyaz Ka Paratha** , is a common alternative to cooked vegetable paratha like aloo or gobi paratha. Generally, it is prepared by stuffing the besan and onion-based masala inside the wheat dough bread. But it can also be done by mixing the spiced onion directly with the dough to make it Onion Roti.
There are many use cases for this paratha; the most common purpose is to pack it up in lunch or tiffin boxes. Compared to other parathas, which typically need more effort to cook vegetables. However, **Onion Paratha** does not include such complicated steps and procedures. It only takes 5-7 minutes to prepare the stuffing and hence can be prepared in a jiffy. Moreover, the spice stuffing is balanced and requires no additional sides or condiments.

## Notes
  * Firstly, adding besan helps absorb the moisture from the stuffing.
  * Also, make sure to prepare the stuffing just before making paratha. Else the onion will release moisture and will be difficult to roll.
  * Additionally, the paratha must be roasted well so the onion will get cooked well.
  * Finally, roasting the paratha with ghee gives it a nice flavor to **Pyaz Paratha Recipe**.

## About Maddur Vada
It is a simple, crisp, and crunchy deep-fried snack recipe made with a combination of rice flour, maida, and rava/sooji. The **Maddur Vada** most commonly known as **Maddur Vade** hails from the small town of Maddur from Karnataka. It is most commonly known to serve as an evening snack with a cup of tea or coffee, but not limited to it. It can also be an ideal side dish for any type of meal, including rasam rice or dal rice combo meal.
There are many different types of **Maddur Vada** , but the most common is made with rice flour, maida, and rava. The taste of this snack is derived from the onions combined with the above dry ingredients. The juice from onions is infused into the dough and tastes great when deep fried in low flame. The same vada can also be made with wheat flour as an alternative to maida. This makes it healthy but may not be a tasty snack. In addition, adding rava helps to make it crisp and crunchy, but optional.

## About Khanavali Badanekayi Palya:
It is basically a spicy baingan sabzi recipe with a blend of spices from North Karnataka cuisine. It is particularly famous with the North Karnataka Khanavali restaurants which serve this curry with flatbreads like jowar roti, ragi roti, or even akki rotti. There are different styles to make this curry which mainly differs from dry to gravy-based curries. But the most popular is the gravy based **badanekayi palya** which can also be served with rice or pulao too.
North Karnataka cuisine is known for its spiciness, especially with the range of curries it has to offer. The same set of spice mix is obvious in this recipe too. Particularly the use of Niger Seeds or locally known as gurellu elevates the flavor and aroma of any recipe. As a matter of fact, these seeds are added to almost all recipes, and the combination of roti, **badanekayi palya,** and gurellu chutney powder is the most popular one.

## About Shahi Paneer Masala
It is a classical North Indian rich and creamy curry recipe prepared with a combination of dry fruits with onion sauce and paneer cubes. In **Shahi Paneer** , the word ‘Shahi’ literally means royal in Hindi, and the reference is attached mainly because of its rich and luxurious profile. It is also believed that the recipe and the gravy sauce were first introduced during the Mughal empires and served to the royal family. Hence, it carries the name and serves it on auspicious and religious occasions.
A simple and creamy **Shahi Paneer Masala Recipe** is prepared in many ways. The most common way is to make it with a combination of nuts like almonds, cashews, and walnuts and diced onions. The tomato is skipped as it does not yield a rich colour, however in some variation, even tomatoes are added. Adding tomatoes will change their colour and texture, and it is typically added in dhaba-style recipes. Further, the curry can also be used as a multi-purpose sauce and other vegetables and meat tenders can be added to the same sauce.

## About Lachha Paratha
It is perhaps one of the easy and simple paratha prepared without any stuffing and the selling point is its flakiness. **Lachha Paratha** most commonly known as **Lachha Parantha** is a popular North Indian or Punjabi cuisine paratha recipe. The additional layered flakiness gives it an edge compared to other stuffed parathas, thus making it more attractive and appetizing.
There are many different types of **Lachha Paratha** recipes across India. The different types of paratha are mainly derived from the combination of flour used to make it. The main hero combination is wheat and plain flour, but most commonly just wheat flour is used. The same layered paratha can also be made with just plain flour. This is very similar to Kerala paratha and known for its taste and softness.

## About Gobi Paratha
An easy and simple stuffed paratha recipe prepared with wheat flour dough, stuffed with raw cauliflower grate, and mixed herbs and spices. **Cauliflower paratha** most commonly known as **Gobi Paratha** is a staple food from North India and is often served as an alternative to Aloo Paratha. It is typically loaded with spice and savory stuffing and hence does not require any additional sides and condiments. However, it tastes even better when served with mint or yogurt raita or with any desired curries and sabzi.
There are many different ways to make this simple and healthy **Gobi Paratha**. The most common and popular way is to make the stuffing with raw gobi grate and mix it with spices and herbs. However, there is another popular way to cook the cauliflower first and then mash it and prepare the stuffing. In addition, the cooked cauliflower can also be mixed directly into the wheat dough. This is much easier and simpler to cook. Lastly, in the place of wheat flour, plain or maida flour can also be used to make it more tasty.

## About Paneer Ki Sabji
An easy and simple, yet premium curry recipe prepared with diced paneer cubes in a spicy and tangy onion tomato gravy. **Paneer Ki Sabji** or **Quick Paneer Curry** can be an ideal gravy curry that can be served with multiple types of Indian flat breads like roti and chapati but not limited to. It can also be a fancy side dish for flavored rice recipes like jeera rice, pulao, and fried rice.
There are different types of **paneer ki sabzi** across India, but the most popular way is dhaba-style curry. It is mainly prepared with simple onion and tomato gravy with additional thick yogurt or curd. Adding yogurt makes it thick and creamy and also helps to get that thick gravy consistency. In addition, adding cashew paste, and cooking cream makes it more fancy and more flavored.

## About Mixed Veg Handi
It is a classical North Indian cuisine mixed vegetable curry prepared using a traditional clay pot known as handi. **Mixed Veg Handi** gets its name from the traditional clay pot used to prepare curry. As such there are no additional ingredients or cooking techniques, but the use of a clay pot makes it special and gives a unique taste to it. It can be best served with a range of Indian flatbreads, but the best choice is garlic naan, tandoori roti, and jeer rice.
Traditionally, **Mixed Veg Handi** or **Veg Diwani Handi** is prepared and served in North Indian or Punjabi dhabas. The roadside dhabas typically use basic and less fancy crockeries to cook most of the curries and recipes. Hence most of the curries started getting the name with the technique or utensils associated with it. Handi curry is one such recipe where the name is mainly associated with the way it is prepared.

It is a simple and easy Indian flatbread recipe with spiced potato stuffing and baked in a traditional tandoor oven. **Aloo Kulcha** popularly known as **Amritsari Kulcha** is a popular alternative to the tandoori roti or garlic naan bread. Unlike other Indian breads, the kulcha is made with plain flour or maida, making it an attractive loaf of tasty bread. The bread is typically served with a range of yogurt dips and raita, but it can also be served with any Indian curries.
There are many different types of Kulcha recipes and the variation mainly depends upon the type of stuffing used. The most popular stuffing has to be the potato, but there is no limit to the different types of stuffing that can be made. The other most popular stuffing combination is Aloo Gobi stuffing with the same bread dough. In addition, traditionally the bread is baked in the tandoor oven, but it can also be baked using tawa on a gas cooktop.

## Chef Tips for Aloo Kulcha
The recipe does not have any complicated steps and ingredients, yet some critical tips for a soft Aloo Kucha are –
  1. **Flour Type –** Traditionally, the bread kulcha is made with plain flour or maida flour. This flour makes it ideal for texture and taste. However, wheat flour or a combination of wheat and plain flour can also be used.
  2. **Stuffing –** The stuffing has to be thick and silky without any lumps in between. This helps to stuff easily and also roll the bread without any difficulty.
  3. **Cooking Technique –** Traditional ovens can be difficult to source to bake this kulcha at home. This recipe post shows a practical solution for using a tawa and gas cooktop mimicking the tandoor oven cooking.
  4. **Accompaniment –** Generally, any sour and creamy yogurt dip or raita makes it a perfect accompaniment. Yet any dry or gravy-based curry can be a perfect choice too.
  5. **Variations –** The stuffing can take any type of cooked vegetable mash and it is open-ended. In addition, the dough can also be prepared with a 1:1 ratio of wheat and plain flour.

## About Paneer Paratha
It is a simple and healthy popular cottage cheese stuffed flatbread recipe made and served for morning breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The **Paneer Paratha** is loaded with a filling stuffing that can be easily the best choice for lunch boxes or tiffin boxes. There are many ways it is served, but the most common way is to serve with a flavored yogurt or curd raita. However, not limited and can also be served with a range of curries.
There are many ways to make this simple and flavored **Paneer Paratha recipe**. But the most common and popular way is to make it with basic paneer crumble and a range of basic spices added to it. This not only keeps it simple to prepare but also makes it to the point. The other most common way is to make it with other cooked and mashed vegetables. The popular choice is the mashed and boiled potatoes or cauliflower. However, the experiment is open-ended and can be tweaked as per preference.

## Chef Tips for Paneer Paratha
The recipe for any paratha is extremely simple without any complications or complicated ingredients used in it. It goes the same for this recipe too, yet some simple and mandatory tips are –
  1. **Paneer –** Use fresh moist and preferably homemade paneer for this paratha. Store-bought paneer comes adulterated and can be hard to crumble and eventually for stuffing.
  2. **Spice Mixture –** The basic spice mixture used for this recipe is chilli powder, garam masala, and amchur powder. However, the spice mixture can further be increased, and depending upon taste buds, you can add kasuri methi, chaat masala, etc.
  3. **Moist Dough –** The dough has to be soft and moist so that it can be easily shaped and pleated. There are many different pleating and stuffing techniques, but having moist and soft dough helps to pleat in any shape.
  4. **Cooking Method –** Use a preheated griddle or tawa to roast the rolled and stuffed paratha. If the tawa is not heated properly, it may stick to the tawa and cannot be easily flipped.
  5. **Accompaniments –** The paratha does not require any mandatory side dish, yet can be served with basic to fancy accompaniments. The most common is flavored yogurt or raita, but it can also be served with a range of pickles or any type of curries.

## About Chana Dal Fry
It is a simple and comfortable food made with split Bengal Gram with a tomato onion gravy base. In other words, Chana Dal Masala Fry is a staple food and is often served with a range of flavored rice recipes and may also be served with a range of Indian Flat breads. Typically, it carries a thick texture compared to the other types of lentil curry, mainly because of the nature of the lentils. It is for this reason, that it is often considered a multipurpose curry and hence served with both rice and rotis.
There are many ways this simple Chana Dal Fry recipe can be prepared. The most common and basic way is to prepare with a combination of Bengal Gram and Moong Dal. Adding moong dal helps to get a rich and creamy texture. Additionally, it can also be made with a combination of other lentils like toor, masoor, and urad dal. Further, the way the dal is cooked can vary. Typically, the lentil is pressure-cooked and then tossed with tomato and onions. However, to hasten the cooking process, the onions and tomatoes can also be pressure-cooked.

## Chef Tips for Channa Dal Fry
The recipe is extremely simple to cook and prepare. It requires some of the basic ingredients to prepare with a minimum amount of time. Yet some critical and mandatory tips are –
  1.     1. **Lentil Quality –** The quality of channa dal has to be best and fresh. It should not powder when pressed and is also soggy in nature. You may perhaps, fry it with less oil to make it crisp before pressure cooking it.
    2. **Pressure Cooking –** Typically, the combination of lentils is just pressure-cooked and then tossed with tomato and onion gravy base. This helps to maximize the flavors and also evenly cook the lentils as compared to pressure cooking tomatoes & onions with lentils.
    3. **Garnish –** Typically, the cooked dal is garnished with Ghee tempering and fresh coriander leaves. However, it can also be garnished with finely chopped onions and carrot grates to make it a perfect multipurpose curry.
    4. **Lentil Combination –** The ideal combination of this recipe is Moong Dal with Chana Dal. Yet you can experiment with other types of dal like Toor, Masoor, and Urad dal for the same purpose.
    5. **Texture –** The recipe has to be thick and dense in nature with Bengal Gram almost cooked. It should hold its shape yet easily digestible and dissolve when pressed. Adding Moong Dal or Toor helps get a rich and creamy texture.

If we add salt, usually dal wont cook properly. Is this dish meant to have salt to have dal not cook properly?

The ingredients used for this recipe are basic and can be easily available in any dry-season state. Rajasthan is a dry and hot climate state, and the recipe suits its demographic. Moreover, the heat from the chiles provides the necessary, and hence it is prominent in Rajasthani cuisine.
In addition, the use of **Bharwa Mirchi** or **Stuffed Chilies** is multiple. Typically, it is made and served as a side dish snack, but it can also be made as gravy-based curries for roti and rice.

## Faqs

### What is rava dosa? What goes well with rava dosa?
Rava dosa is a popular crepe south Indian recipe made of semolina, rice flour, and maida. they do not require any grinding or fermentation, making an instant dosa. The rava dosa batter is thin compared to regular urad dal dosa batter, which yields crispy and flaky dosa. it is served for morning breakfast or evening snacks with coconut chutney, spicy chutney, veg kurma, sagu, or sambar.

### How to get a crispy rava dosa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-12.jpeg> "crispy rava dosa")

### What are the ingredients of rava dosa and how to prepare rava dosa?
rava dosa is usually prepared with semolina, rice flour, maida, spices, and fresh herbs. First, take a bowl and add rava, rice flour, and maida to it. rava and rice flour should be in the same proportions, and maida should be half of the rava and rice flour. add salt, 1 tbsp of curd, and water to it. also, add chopped chilli, curry leaves, ginger, pepper, cumin seeds, and coriander leaves. add more water to prepare a flowing consistency batter. rest the batter for 20 minutes. sp that the rava absorbs water. pour the batter into the hot tawa and roast in low flame until the dosa leaves the tawa or turns golden brown and crisp.

### What are the other variants to prepare tasty rava dosa?
Adding chopped onions to the rava dosa batter makes onion rava dosa and adding aloo bhaji while roasting the dosa yields rava masala dosa just like traditional masala dosa. adding dry fruits to the dosa makes it a dry fruit rava dosa. the addition of finely chopped or grated veggies makes vegetable rava dosa. also, chopped cashew nuts and coconut pieces can be added to the batter, making the dosa more tasty and crunchy in every bite. adding curd to the dosa gives the golden colour and a good flavour to the dosa.

### Why does rava dosa stick to the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-10.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
Always use a heavy bottom pan or well-seasoned cast-iron tawa to make rava dosa. An iron skillet pan is the best for preparing dosas. Seasoned tawa is the one that is used earlier to prepare dosa. grease the pan well and rub it with a slice of onion before pouring each dosa. Also, do not use the same tawa when preparing roti or chapati. maintain the tawa separately for both. If the dosa sticks to the non-stick tawa, pour some batter into it and prepare a small dosa. After 2-3 dosas, the dosas won’t stick to the pan as the tawa would be hot.

### Why is my rava dosa soft and not crispy?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-9.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
You need to use Bombay rava or fine rava. The batter should be thin and watery in consistency, not thick or medium. Medium-consistency batter also yields soft dosa. add water to the dosa batter to adjust the consistency. Adding more curd to the batter may yield soft dosas. The tawa should be very hot, and the flame should be low soon after pouring the batter into the tawa. Mix well every time you pour the batter on the tawa, and the rava and other flours settle down. Use a heavy bottom pan or cast iron tawa to prepare dosa so that it does not stick to the tawa and helps to get crispy dosa. also, serve dosa hot. else when they cool down, they turn soft.

### Should we flip over the dosa and roast on both sides in rava dosa?
Flipping of dosa is not required while roasting the rava dosa. When the dosa is cooked well, fold and remove it from the tawa. All the dosa needn’t be cooked on both sides. If the dosas are getting brown at the bottom and still moist on the top side, you may need to flip over the dosa and roast it on the other side until it turns crisp. So, as soon as the dosa is poured into the tawa, adjust the flame to low. cover and roast until the edges leave the tawa. Do not forcibly remove the dosa from the pan. A cooked dosa leaves the tawa, which indicates the cooking is done.

### How to pour the rava dosa batter into the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-7.jpeg> "rava dosa recipe")
The batter should be mainly thin or watery like flowing consistency. Only then is it possible to pour the batter. unlike traditional dosa, the batter is poured on the tawa, and the batter is not spread. pour it all over the tawa, beginning from the edges and towards the centre, and do not pour the batter in one place. fill the gaps by pouring the batter into them. cover and roast in low flame until it leaves the pan.

### What does my rava dosa break?
When you pour the batter into the tawa, make sure the batter is thin and flowing consistency. if it’s too skinny, the dosa might break. so add rice flour, maida, and rava according to their proportion and adjust the consistency, pour the batter into the pan.

### how to season the dosa tawa?
dosa tawa can be seasoned in the following ways: rub the tawa with gingelly oil and soak it in washed rice water for a week. rub the tawa with half the onion before spreading the dosas. heat the tawa, sprinkle salt, switch off the flame, wipe with a cloth and grease oil after it cools. clean the tawa with hot water and rub it with oil. Please keep it in the oven for one-hour upside down. Also, please do not wash the tawa when it is too hot, and do not put cold liquids on the cast iron tawa. avoid hard soaps, detergents, and steel scrubbers.

## About Atta Besan Ladoo
It is a simple combination of 2 recipes, i.e. wheat and besan ladoo, combined to make a classic Indian dessert recipe. Traditionally, besan ladoo is prepared during festivals and religious ceremonies. However, it can have health concerns, as chickpea flour can upset your stomach. Hence, to mitigate this problem, a new Laddu recipe is prepared. One is the Atta Ladoo, commonly called the **Atta Besan Ladoo recipe**. It has the same taste and crunchiness as besan but carries the health benefits of wheat flour.
There are many ways to make a simple and healthy **Atta Besan Ladoo recipe**. The most common way is to prepare it with a combination of wheat and chickpea flour with a 1:1 ratio. This gets the best of both. However, the ratio can be altered to make a unique sweet recipe. In addition, adding roasted rava or semolina makes it crisp and crunchy. Further, adding assorted dry fruits with dry ingredients makes it a memorable and premium sweet dessert recipe.

## About Mango Dal

It is typically served with hot steamed rice with a hot ghee topping and spicy mango pickle as a side or condiments. It can also be an excellent choice as a curry with a wide range of Indian flatbreads.
There are many different variations to this simple and easy **Raw Mango Dal** or **Mango Pappu Recipe**. The most common way is to make it with a combination of toor dal and raw mangoes with a thick consistency. The variations are mainly derived from its consistency.

## Faqs

### What is rava dosa? What goes well with rava dosa?
Rava dosa is a popular crepe south Indian recipe made of semolina, rice flour, and maida. they do not require any grinding or fermentation, making an instant dosa.

### How to get a crispy rava dosa?

### What are the ingredients of rava dosa and how to prepare rava dosa?
rava dosa is usually prepared with semolina, rice flour, maida, spices, and fresh herbs. First, take a bowl and add rava, rice flour, and maida to it. rava and rice flour should be in the same proportions, and maida should be half of the rava and rice flour. add salt, 1 tbsp of curd, and water to it. also, add chopped chilli, curry leaves, ginger, pepper, cumin seeds, and coriander leaves. add more water to prepare a flowing consistency batter. rest the batter for 20 minutes. sp that the rava absorbs water. pour the batter into the hot tawa and roast in low flame until the dosa leaves the tawa or turns golden brown and crisp.

### What are the other variants to prepare tasty rava dosa?
Adding chopped onions to the rava dosa batter makes onion rava dosa and adding aloo bhaji while roasting the dosa yields rava masala dosa just like traditional masala dosa. adding dry fruits to the dosa makes it a dry fruit rava dosa. the addition of finely chopped or grated veggies makes vegetable rava dosa. also, chopped cashew nuts and coconut pieces can be added to the batter, making the dosa more tasty and crunchy in every bite. adding curd to the dosa gives the golden colour and a good flavour to the dosa.

### Why does rava dosa stick to the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-10.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
Always use a heavy bottom pan or well-seasoned cast-iron tawa to make rava dosa. An iron skillet pan is the best for preparing dosas. Seasoned tawa is the one that is used earlier to prepare dosa. grease the pan well and rub it with a slice of onion before pouring each dosa. Also, do not use the same tawa when preparing roti or chapati. maintain the tawa separately for both. If the dosa sticks to the non-stick tawa, pour some batter into it and prepare a small dosa. After 2-3 dosas, the dosas won’t stick to the pan as the tawa would be hot.

### Why is my rava dosa soft and not crispy?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-9.jpeg> "instant rava dosa")
You need to use Bombay rava or fine rava. The batter should be thin and watery in consistency, not thick or medium. Medium-consistency batter also yields soft dosa. add water to the dosa batter to adjust the consistency. Adding more curd to the batter may yield soft dosas. The tawa should be very hot, and the flame should be low soon after pouring the batter into the tawa. Mix well every time you pour the batter on the tawa, and the rava and other flours settle down. Use a heavy bottom pan or cast iron tawa to prepare dosa so that it does not stick to the tawa and helps to get crispy dosa. also, serve dosa hot. else when they cool down, they turn soft.

### Should we flip over the dosa and roast on both sides in rava dosa?
Flipping of dosa is not required while roasting the rava dosa. When the dosa is cooked well, fold and remove it from the tawa. All the dosa needn’t be cooked on both sides. If the dosas are getting brown at the bottom and still moist on the top side, you may need to flip over the dosa and roast it on the other side until it turns crisp. So, as soon as the dosa is poured into the tawa, adjust the flame to low. cover and roast until the edges leave the tawa. Do not forcibly remove the dosa from the pan. A cooked dosa leaves the tawa, which indicates the cooking is done.

### How to pour the rava dosa batter into the tawa?
 ](https://hebbarskitchen.com/instant-rava-dosa-recipe-suji-ka-dosa/<https:/hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rava-dosa-recipe-instant-rava-dosa-suji-ka-dosa-crispy-rava-dosa-7.jpeg> "rava dosa recipe")
The batter should be mainly thin or watery like flowing consistency. Only then is it possible to pour the batter. unlike traditional dosa, the batter is poured on the tawa, and the batter is not spread. pour it all over the tawa, beginning from the edges and towards the centre, and do not pour the batter in one place. fill the gaps by pouring the batter into them. cover and roast in low flame until it leaves the pan.

### What does my rava dosa break?
When you pour the batter into the tawa, make sure the batter is thin and flowing consistency. if it’s too skinny, the dosa might break. so add rice flour, maida, and rava according to their proportion and adjust the consistency, pour the batter into the pan.

### how to season the dosa tawa?
dosa tawa can be seasoned in the following ways: rub the tawa with gingelly oil and soak it in washed rice water for a week. rub the tawa with half the onion before spreading the dosas. heat the tawa, sprinkle salt, switch off the flame, wipe with a cloth and grease oil after it cools. clean the tawa with hot water and rub it with oil. Please keep it in the oven for one-hour upside down. Also, please do not wash the tawa when it is too hot, and do not put cold liquids on the cast iron tawa. avoid hard soaps, detergents, and steel scrubbers.

Looks Amazing. Just a small suggestion. For cooking dhall and rice, instead of using just water, try to use milk and water combined. Milk will gives a rich taste and creamy texture to pongal. Thanks.

## About Lemon Rasam
This is an easy yet healthy rasam or thin soup recipe made with lentil water and a hint of fresh herbs and spices. Once **Lemon Rasam** or **Nimbu Rasam** is prepared, it is topped with a generous amount of lemon juice, hence the name lemon rasam. It is typically served just before the meal as soup or as an appetiser with rice before the sambar rice meal. It also carries medicinal health benefits, and hence, it is served during indigestion or constipation problems.
There are many different ways to make this simple **Lemon Rasam recipe**. The most common way is to make it with leftover lentil-cooked water, which gives it a thin, watery consistency. However, it can also be made with moderate thickness by adding the cooked lentils to diluted water. The other way is to make it without lentils; it is cooked with water, herbs, spices, and lemon topping.

## About Curd Dosa
It is an easy, simple, soft, spongy dosa made with semolina, beaten rice, and sour curd or yogurt. Curd Dosa most commonly known as Sponge Dosa is an instant variant of the Set Dosa recipe. It is instant and does not require additional fermentation, soaking, and grounding which makes it super convenient. Typically, it can be served with any type of chutney, but it tastes great when served with spicy curry like kurma and any meat or potato curries.
There are many types of **curd dosa** and **sponge dosa** but the most common way is to make with semolina and Poha. These 2 dry ingredients are mixed with curd to make a medium-textured dosa batter. The same dosa can also be made with rice flour or idli rava. The texture of the latter can be different and may not be as soft as semolina. In addition, the same dosa can be made with rice and urad dal, but it does require soaking, grounding, and fermentation.

  3. Sowmya 
Can we store the batter without adding curd and add curd night before we wanna make?
     *  
Hi Sowmya, curd helps in fermentation here. As we are not adding urad dal, curd would be essential to ferment the batter
  4. Karen

## About Ven Pongal
It is a popular and flavored South Indian rice & lentil-based dish, with a huge fan following in Tamilnadu and Karnataka. **Khara Ven Pongal** or **Ghee Pongal** is typically served as a combo meal for morning breakfast with either dosa, idli, or vada. But not limited to it, and can also served as a simple meal with chutney or sambar as a taste enhancer. It is typically cooked with rice and moong dal in equal ratio for a dense and balanced meal.
There are many popular ways to make this **Ghee Ven Pongal** , but the most common way is to make it with an equal ratio of moong dal and rice. It can be made with toor dal and rice, but you may not get the same creamy and rich texture. In addition, the other most popular way is to make it sweet with jaggery or sugar. The sweet variation is typically prepared as Prasadam and prepared during festivals and celebrations.

## About Idli Chutney
This is a classical adaptation of the simple coconut chutney which carries a unique and Idli-friendly texture and taste. In other words, **Idli chutney** has a more watery texture which acts like sambar and makes it easy to consume the soft and moist idli. Having said that the chutney is not limited to it. It can also be used for other South Indian breakfast recipes too. Particularly, it can also be an ideal choice for dosa, paddu, appam, and even for Idiyappam rice noodles.
There are different ways to make this simple chutney, but the common ingredient used is coconut. Depending upon the region and the additional ingredient used, the taste and consistency changes to this **Idli Chutney**. The most common ingredient used is roasted channa dal, but it can also take roasted peanuts. Also for the sourness, you can add raw mangoes in place of tamarind.

## About Easy Tomato Rasam in Cooker:
It is basically a quick and easy version of the traditional tomato rasam recipe prepared with all the ingredients cooked in a pressure cooker. In other words, it is a one-pot rasam recipe without the hassle of using multiple vessels and mixing ingredients one by one. It can be a perfect rasam especially if you need something in a jiffy and focus on other recipes while it gets pressure cooked.
There are many types of rasam recipe which basically differs in the set of ingredients and the way it is prepared. However, this post covers a basic tomato and toor dal-based rasam which is quite popular across India. Basically, any type of rasam with or without dal can follow the same technique as shown here. Perhaps, if no dal is used, the use of a cooker is not mandatory, but it should be a significant contributor.

Hello, thank you for the recipe. I was wondering, can fresh coconut be substituted for dry coconut and what changes the recipe will need in that case. I’d not, can coconut be omitted altogether? Thank you!
